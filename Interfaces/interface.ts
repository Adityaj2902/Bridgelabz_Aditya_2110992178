// An interface in TypeScript is a way to define the shape or structure of an object. 
// It is used to specify what properties or methods an object should have, without actually implementing them. 
// Think of it as a blueprint for an object.



interface Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    greet(): void;
}

class Employee implements Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;

    constructor(name: string, age: number) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    greet() {
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
    }
}

const Aditya = new Employee('Aditya',18);

Aditya.greet();
