// An interface in TypeScript is a way to define the shape or structure of an object. 
// It is used to specify what properties or methods an object should have, without actually implementing them. 
// Think of it as a blueprint for an object.

    function Employee(name, age) {
        this.name = name;

// interfaces are used to define the structure of an object. 
// They act as a blueprint that specifies the shape of an object,
//  including its properties and method signatures. However, 
//  interfaces do not provide implementationsâ€”they only enforce the presence of certain properties 
//  and methods in any class that implements them.
